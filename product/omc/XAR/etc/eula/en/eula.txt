IMPORTANT. READ CAREFULLY: 

This End User License Agreement (“EULA”) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single entity) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (“Samsung”) for software, whether pre-installed or downloaded, owned by Samsung and its affiliated companies and its third party suppliers and licensors, that accompanies this EULA, which includes computer software and may include associated media, content and data, printed materials, or electronic documentation in connection with your use of Samsung Mobile Device, which will be defined below(“Samsung Software”). 
By using this device or any other Samsung mobile product, including mobile phones and tablets, running on Android operating system (“Samsung Mobile Device”), you accept the terms of this EULA. If you do not accept these terms, do not use the Samsung Mobile Device or the Samsung Software.
 

1. GRANT OF LICENSE. 

Samsung grants you a limited non-exclusive license to install, use, access, display and run one copy of the Samsung Software on a single Samsung Mobile Device, local hard disk(s) or other permanent storage media of one computer and you may not make Samsung Software available over a network where it could be used by multiple computers at the same time. You may make one copy of the Samsung Software in machine readable form for backup purposes only; provided that the backup copy must include all copyright or other proprietary notices contained on the original. 
Certain items of the Samsung Software may be subject to open source licenses. The open source license provisions may override some of the terms of this EULA. We make the applicable open source licenses available to you on the Legal Notices section of the Settings menu of your device.

2. RESERVATION OF RIGHTS AND OWNERSHIP.

Samsung reserves all rights not expressly granted to you in this EULA. The Software is protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws and treaties. Samsung or its suppliers own the title, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the Software. The Software is licensed, not sold.

3. LIMITATIONS ON END USER RIGHTS.

You may not, nor enable others to, copy, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or algorithms of, the Software (except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law not withstanding this limitation), or modify, or disable any features of, the Software, or create derivative works based on the Software. You may not rent, lease, lend, sublicense or provide commercial hosting services with the Software. You may not transfer this EULA or the rights to the Samsung Software granted herein to any third party unless it is in connection with the sale of the mobile device which the Samsung Software accompanied. In such event, the transfer must include all of the Samsung Software (including all component parts, the media and printed materials, any upgrades, this EULA) and you may not retain any copies of the Samsung Software. The transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a consignment. Prior to the transfer, the end user receiving the Samsung Software must agree to all the EULA terms.

4. SAMSUNG SOFTWARE UPDATES.

Samsung may make available to you updates, upgrades, supplements and add-on components (if any) of the Samsung Software, including bug fixes, service upgrades (parts or whole), and updates, enhancements and feature improvements or deletion to any Samsung Software (including entirely new versions), (collectively “Update”) after the date you obtain your initial copy of the Samsung Software. This EULA applies to all and any component of the Update, unless we provide other terms along with such Update. To use Samsung Software provided through Update, you must first be licensed for the Samsung Software identified by Samsung as eligible for the Update. 
While the Update will be generally available, in some limited circumstances, the Samsung Software updates will only be offered by your network carrier, and such Samsung Software updates will be governed by your contractual relationship with your network carrier. 
Your device may download certain Updates automatically from time to time through Wi-Fi or other network connection. You may change the settings in your device to manually download the Updates; however, given the importance of receiving Updates for security software in a timely manner, and to resolve critical problems reported to Samsung, and to defend against new threats and vulnerabilities, these Updates may be automatically downloaded and installed. We recommend you to check availability of any new Updates periodically for optimal use of your device. 
For devices with a SIM card: 
 Your SIM card stores information about your service plan with your provider, and this information is tied to the device on which the SIM is activated. If you move your SIM card to another device, you won’t receive software updates unless you update your service plan with the new device.

5. CONSENT TO USE OF DATA.

(a) Privacy Policy.  Collection of data using software or applications on your device will be performed in accordance with the provisions of this section and as set forth in Samsung’s Privacy Policy. For your reference, Samsung’s Privacy Policy can be viewed at: http://account.samsung.com/membership/pp.

(b) To provide updates to the Samsung Software, you agree that Samsung and its affiliates may collect and use technical information gathered as part of the product support services related to the Software provided to you, if any, such as IMEI (your device's unique identification number), device number, model name, customer code, access recording, your device's current software version, MCC (Mobile Country Code), and MNC (Mobile Network Code). Samsung may use this information to improve their products or to provide customized services or technologies to you and will not disclose this information in a form that personally identifies you.

(c) Diagnostic and Usage Data. If you opt in to diagnostic and usage collection, Samsung and its affiliates may collect maintain, process and use diagnostic, technical and usage related information (“Diagnostic and Usage Data”), that is gathered to provide and improve Samsung products and services, facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you, if any, related to the Samsung Software, and to verify compliance with the terms of this License. Samsung may use this information for the purposes described above and in accordance with its Privacy Policy available at the hyperlink above.

(d) Location Data. As described in the Samsung Privacy Policy, available for view at the hyperlink above, Samsung and its partners, licensees and third party developers may provide certain services that rely upon location information, such as your device’s GPS signal or information about nearby WiFi access points and cell towers that may be transmitted to us, with your consent, when you use such location enabled services. 

(e) Device Identifier-based Services. To facilitate the use of enhanced messaging and file sharing functions with a simplified set up process, device identifier-based services for file sharing features and messaging features (“Device Identifier-based Services”) are provided within the Samsung Software. These features are available through existing interfaces of Contacts and Messages, respectively, as additional features to them. If you opt-in to Device Identifier-based Services, certain unique identifiers for your Samsung Mobile Device are needed to set up and use these features. These unique identifiers may include hardware identifiers, subscription information and telephone number for your Samsung Mobile Device. If you allow sharing of Contacts information, the telephone numbers of the people in your Contacts are collected by Samsung to facilitate file sharing and messaging with the people in your Contacts. You may turn off this sharing feature or restrict the scope of the sharing under your profile settings. 
If your message cannot be sent as a message using the Device Identifier-based Services, your message may be sent as an SMS or MMS message, for which carrier messaging rates may apply.

(f) Voice-based Features. As described in the Samsung Privacy Policy, available for view at the hyperlink above, in order to provide Voice-based features we may require the collection of your voice information. Some voice-based services may not be available in all languages or in all countries. 

(g) Samsung Keyboard. If you opt in to the Predictive text feature, the words that you typed are collected and stored on your Samsung Mobile Device to provide a word suggestion that you would be typing. You can clear the collected typing data anytime under the Predictive text settings. This feature may be offered in connection with your Samsung Account to synchronize the data for use on your other Samsung Mobile Devices and you can also clear the server side data under the Predictive text settings.

6. INTERNET ACCESS.

Some features of the Samsung Software may require your device to access the Internet and may be subject to restrictions imposed by your network or Internet provider. Unless your device is connected to the Internet through Wi-Fi connection, the Samsung Software will access the internet through your mobile network, which may result in additional charges depending on your payment plan. In addition, your enjoyment of some features of the Samsung Software may be affected by the suitability and performance of your device hardware or data access. (The automatic updates feature downloads any updates only through an active Wi-Fi connection.)

7. EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.

You acknowledge that the Samsung Software is subject to export restrictions of various countries. You agree to comply with all applicable international and national laws that apply to the Samsung Software, including all the applicable export restriction laws and regulations.

Upon termination of this EULA, you must cease all use of the Samsung Software and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Samsung Software.

The Samsung Software is licensed only with “restricted rights” and as “commercial items” consisting of “commercial software” and “commercial software documentation” with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. All Products are provided only with “restricted rights” with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. All Samsung Software and Products are provided subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 52.227.19. 

15. APPLICABLE LAW.

This EULA shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA without reference to its conflict of law provisions. This EULA shall not be governed by the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. Samsung may apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent form of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

16. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.

ALL DISPUTES WITH SAMSUNG ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THIS LIMITED WARRANTY OR THE SALE, CONDITION OR PERFORMANCE OF THE PRODUCTS SHALL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION, AND NOT BY A COURT OR JURY. ANY SUCH DISPUTE SHALL NOT BE COMBINED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH A DISPUTE INVOLVING ANY OTHER PERSON’S OR ENTITY’S PRODUCT OR CLAIM, AND SPECIFICALLY, WITHOUT LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, SHALL NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES PROCEED AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION. THE ARBITRATION SHALL BE CONDUCTED BEFORE A SINGLE ARBITRATOR, WHOSE AWARD MAY NOT EXCEED, IN FORM OR AMOUNT, THE RELIEF ALLOWED BY THE APPLICABLE LAW. The arbitration shall be conducted according to the American Arbitration Association (AAA) Commercial Arbitration Rules applicable to consumer disputes. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. This arbitration provision is entered pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator shall decide all issues of interpretation and application of this arbitration provision and the EULA. For any arbitration in which your total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert witness fees, are $5,000.00 or less (“Small Claim”), the arbitrator may, if you prevail, award your reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and costs as part of any award, but may not grant Samsung its attorney fees, expert witness fees or costs unless it is determined that the claim was brought in bad faith. In a Small Claim case, you shall be required to pay no more than half of the total administrative, facility and arbitrator fees, or $50.00 of such fees, whichever is less, and Samsung shall pay the remainder of such fees. Administrative, facility and arbitrator fees for arbitrations in which your total damage claims, exclusive of attorney fees and expert witness fees, exceed $5,000.00 (“Large Claim”) shall be determined according to AAA rules. In a Large Claim case, the arbitrator may grant to the prevailing party, or apportion among the parties, reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees and costs. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator’s award in any court of competent jurisdiction. 
 This arbitration provision also applies to claims against Samsung’s employees, representatives and affiliates if any such claim arises from the licensing or use of the Software. 
 You may opt out of this dispute resolution procedure by providing notice to SAMSUNG no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the first consumer purchaser’s purchase of the Product. To opt out, you must send notice by e-mail to optout@sea.samsung.com, with the subject line: “Arbitration Opt Out.” You must include in the opt out e-mail (a) your name and address; (b) the date on which the Product was purchased; (c) the Product model name or model number; and (d) the IMEI or MEID or Serial Number, as applicable, if you have it (the IMEI or MEID or Serial Number can be found (i) on the Product box; (ii) on the Product information screen, which can be found under “Settings;” (iii) on a label on the back of the Product beneath the battery, if the battery is removable; and (iv) on the outside of the Product if the battery is not removable). Alternatively, you may opt out by calling 1-800-SAMSUNG (726-7864) no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the first consumer purchaser’s purchase of the Product and providing the same information. These are the only two forms of notice that will be effective to opt out of this dispute resolution procedure. Opting out of this dispute resolution procedure will not affect the coverage of the Limited Warranty in any way, and you will continue to enjoy the benefits of the Limited Warranty.

17. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY.

This EULA is the entire agreement between you and Samsung relating to the Samsung Software and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals and representations with respect to the Samsung Software or any other subject matter covered by this EULA. If any provision of this EULA is held to be void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall continue in full force and effect.
